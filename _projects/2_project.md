### 项目简介
Floating wind and wave are two promising sources for renewable energy. For harnessing these energies, the safety, reliability and survivability of moored floating structures are critical for supporting the energy conversion systems. This requires advanced modelling techniques and thorough understanding of the moored structures in varied ocean conditions. These issues are among the pressing challenges impeding the commercialisation of renewable energy concepts. This project aims at developing a comprehensive and stable numerical method for nonlinear mooring cable dynamics, understanding the cable nonlinear behaviors, and eventually coupling the cable model into state-of-the-art platform models for appreciating the influence of the cable dynamics on platform responses. The proposed study aligns the United Nation’s Agenda 2030 for sustainable development, in particular contributing towards the target for ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. The outcome of the project will be important for sustainably using the ocean resources. For achieving the research goal, the research will start with the state-of-the-art formulation of mooring cable dynamics and develop numerical techniques to improve the numerical stability of the present solving method; the research will afterwards take advantage of advanced nonlinear analysis techniques including harmonic balance method and numerical continuation for characterizing the mooring nonlinear behaviors and identifying critical conditions for further coupling studies; subsequently, the developed cable model will be coupled with reduced-order and high-fidelity platform models for appreciating the influence of cable nonlinearity on structural vibration control design and extreme platform responses respectively.
