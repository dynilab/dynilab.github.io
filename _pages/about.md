At dynilab, our research advances the understanding of dynamic behavior in civil structures, water wave dynamics, ocean infrastructure, and building thermodynamics. Bridging disciplines across structural engineering, fluid mechanics, and energy systems, we develop and apply state-of-the-art numerical methods and artificial intelligence techniques to address complex engineering challenges.

Our work has broad applications in bridge engineering, structural vibration control, and renewable energy systems, with the overarching goal of enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability in the built environment.

动力学数智算控团队研究致力于推进对土木结构动力行为、水波动力学、海洋基础设施以及建筑热力学的理解。研究跨结构工程、流体力学与能源系统等学科，开发并应用先进的数值方法与人工智能技术，解决复杂的工程难题。研究成果在桥梁工程、结构振动控制以及可再生能源系统等领域实现应用，核心目标是提升基础设施的安全性、效率与可持续性。
